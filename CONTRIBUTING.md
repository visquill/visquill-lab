# Contributing

VisQuill Lab is a workshop, not a product. Contributions are welcome, but expectations are intentionally low-key.

## What's welcome

- New concepts or blueprints that demonstrate something genuinely useful
- Fixes for things that are broken or misleading
- Improvements to existing examples — cleaner code, better patterns, missing parameters
- Documentation corrections

## What to expect

There is no formal review process and no guaranteed response time. PRs may sit for a while. If something is clearly useful and doesn't break anything, it will likely get merged eventually.

If you're unsure whether something fits, open an issue first.

## Guidelines

- Follow the existing folder and naming conventions — each demo lives in its own folder, with a `demo.ts` entry point and optional `styles.css`/`styles.scss` and a markdown description
- Add `// @name` and `// @category` metadata at the top of `demo.ts` so the explorer picks it up correctly
- Keep examples focused — one idea per demo
- MIT license applies to everything here; your contributions will be under the same license

## Reporting issues

If something is broken, file an issue with enough detail to reproduce it. No special template required.
