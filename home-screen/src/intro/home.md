# VisQuill Lab

A living repository of demos, examples, and reusable components built with the VisQuill GDK.

**This is a workshop, not a product.** Things get added, changed, and refined over time. Parameters may be missing, patterns may evolve, and some examples are more finished than others. That's intentional.

Everything is MIT licensed — use it as a source of ideas and starting points, adapt what's useful, and expect it to grow.

**GitHub:** [visquill/visquill-lab](https://github.com/visquill/visquill-lab)

## What's in here

**Concepts** demonstrate core GDK features — shapes, reactions, animations, geometry. They're structured to build understanding from first principles.

**Blueprints** are reusable components ready to copy into your own project. Take what you need directly from the source and adapt it.
